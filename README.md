# Hefesto

Hefesto is a multiplatform build system which currently runs on ``Linux``, ``FreeBSD``, ``MINIX`` and ``Windows``.

The main Hefesto's feature is allow a more programatic build scripting.

In order to do it Hefesto uses his own language (more procedural than declarative).

Seeking:

- Clarity
- Organization
- Expansibility

This application can help not only a small amount of programmers which use some specific languages and toolsets, Hefesto helps on automation of several tasks that go beyond just compiling and linking programs. It depends on your necessity and disposition to extend the Hefesto.

When you extend Hefesto this does not mean that you need to recompile the application. All is done via Hsl, the domain specific language which Hefesto implements.

The Hsl was developed to be simple but robust.

In order to build this project follow the steps in [COMPILING.md](https://github.com/rafael-santiago/hefesto/blob/master/COMPILING.md).
