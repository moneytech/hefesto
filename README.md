# Hefesto

``Hefesto`` is a multi platform build system which currently runs on ``Linux``, ``FreeBSD``, ``MINIX``, ``Solaris``, ``NetBSD`` and ``Windows``.

The main ``Hefesto's`` feature is allow a more programatic build scripting.

In order to do it ``Hefesto`` uses his own language (more procedural than declarative).

Seeking:

- Clarity
- Organization
- Expansibility

This application can help not only a small amount of programmers which use some specific languages and toolsets. ``Hefesto`` helps on automating several tasks that go beyond just compiling and linking programs. It depends on your necessity and disposition to extend ``Hefesto``.

When you extend ``Hefesto`` it does not mean that you need to recompile the application. All is done via ``HSL``, the domain specific language which ``Hefesto`` implements.

The ``HSL`` was developed to be simple but robust.

In order to build this project follow the steps in [COMPILING.md](https://github.com/rafael-santiago/hefesto/blob/master/COMPILING.md).
